          <h2>Background Info</h2>
          <p>Columbia City is a diverse neighborhood in Seattle, Washington with a long history. In 1891, an electric railway line was built, which ran through the area, and the surrounding land was developed into a town. After World War II, the neighborhood was in poor conditions, but public and private contributions revitalized Columbia City. Minority groups and other citizens settled in the area and helped the business district grow and thrive. The neighborhood earned the Landmark District status in 1978 and continues to preserve its historic commercial and residential buildings while making room for more public establishments and community events.</p>
